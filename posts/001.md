This will be a place for me to talk about different stuff that interest me, but mostly tech stuff though.

I keep getting fixated on different aspects of tech, and right now (and for the past years or so) it's the Linux terminal. I am 100% obsessed with it, and will probably write some texts about it.

For some background, I am a system developer from Sweden. I am unemployed and looking for my first job in tech, and this is kind of a time kill while waiting.

I imagine the first "real" post will be about tmux, lynx, or maybe alacritty. Or maybe Neovim? Well see.

Stay cool.
